## Kokomo BobKats (L) vs KW Titans (W) 82-98

After a disappointing loss to the Sudbury Five on Friday, the KW Titans tamed the BobKats from Kokomo (Indiana, so nothing to do with the Beach Boys or Tom Cruise throwing tequila bottles).

Standouts for me were Joel Kindred who racked up a bunch of points (28) with 5 threes and Jabari Craig who pulled off 15 points and 11 total rebounds. Eric Ferguson was also strong with 16 points and 8 rebounds.

My favorite player, Chad Frazier (9 points), was a little quiet offensively, but man did he make it impossible for the BobKats to get near the basket. This part of an amazing defensive team effort by the Titans which held the Bobkats to only 12 points in the fourth quarter.

Another great thing to see was Ronald Artest III putting in a great 10 points and 7 rebounds showing some of the physical prowess his famous father, Metta, is known for. I think the refs did not like to see someone so physically dominant, as they called foul after foul on him. Nonetheless, he's settling in well with the Titans and we have a lot to look forward to as the season progresses.

Nicholas McKenzie (18 points) and Chandler Levingston scared the fans in the early going by dropping a few three pointers and gathering an early lead. Johnny Griffin Jr also scored 16 points in a losing effort.
