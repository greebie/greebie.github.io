## My New Space

I feel like there's a recovery going on. Or maybe I'm just hoping. Either way, I think this is the beginning of my new life as a blogger.

If there's one thing that I feel strongly about is that community is essential. We need to talk more about the things that matter to us. Full stop.

Also, more than ever, I believe there needs to be less attention scattered across the globe's brains and more actions that meet the expectations we have for ourselves. COVID may have changed me a bit this way.

Nonetheless, one of the things I look most forward to these days are my beloved [KW Titans](https://www.kwtitans.com/). They had an amazing game last week and man are they working hard to give their fans the best and most exciting experience they can. COVID has hit the organization really hard and the NBLC does not have the same ability to have their own bubble the same the NBA could. I hate seeing people work that hard and not be rewarded for it, which is part of why I started this blog.

I also have some research that I want to share as well. Maybe there will be a book review or two. Maybe I can share some of my projects that I work on from here and there. And some tips I have about teaching effectively. Who knows? I just want to be writing more and screen-timing less. Hopefully you can enjoy that work too.
